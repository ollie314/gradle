        <para>
            This feature is a work in progress. There is no public API for enabling or using this cache; although, you may see references
            to it while we build the underlying infrastructure.

            Task output caching is a new kind of cache mechanism that aims to save time by reusing outputs produced by previous executions of
            a task with matching inputs. Task outputs can be reused between builds of the same project on one computer or even between builds
            running on different computers.
